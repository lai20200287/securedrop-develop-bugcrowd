SecureDrop is an open-source whistleblower submission system that media organizations can use to securely accept documents from, and communicate with anonymous sources. It was originally created by the late Aaron Swartz and is currently managed by the [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press).

## Project status

SecureDrop is a stable, mature project that is actively in use in newsrooms across the globe. Most feature development efforts are focused towards the [SecureDrop Workstation](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-workstation/),
[SecureDrop Client](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client), and [SecureDrop Protocol](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-protocol); see the "[Future directions for SecureDrop](https://securedrop.org/news/future-directions-for-securedrop/)" blog post for more information.

SecureDrop continues to receive security and bug fixes in the meantime.

## Documentation

SecureDrop's end user documentation is hosted at https://docs.securedrop.org. It is maintained in a standalone repository: https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-docs.

By default, the documentation describes the most recent SecureDrop release. This is known as the **stable** version and is recommended for end users (Sources, Journalists, or Administrators). The **latest** documentation is automatically built from the most recent commit to the SecureDrop documentation repository. It is most useful for developers and contributors to the project. You can switch between versions of the documentation by using the toolbar in the bottom left corner of the Read the Docs screen.

Developer documentation can be found at https://developers.securedrop.org/, maintained in
https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-dev-docs/.

## How to Contribute to SecureDrop

See our [contribution page](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Developer Quickstart

To run SecureDrop locally, ensure you have Docker installed and:

```
make dev
```

This will start the source interface on `127.0.0.1:8080` and the journalist interface on `127.0.0.1:8081`. The credentials to login are printed in the Terminal. To login to the journalist interface, you must also [generate a two-factor code](https://developers.securedrop.org/en/latest/setup_development.html#credentials).


To provision a Python 3 virtual environment for development:

```
make venv && source ./venv/bin/activate
```
